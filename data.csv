<p>The Canon BG-E11 Battery Grip is an optional battery grip with improved ergonomics designed specifically for the Canon EOS 5D Mark III. It allows users to load a choice of one or two LP-E6 battery packs. With two packs, the already-impressive battery life is doubled, compared to using a single LP-E6 pack in-camera. This is especially useful when taking advantage of the camera's movie mode or Live View mode - operating modes that use more power. In addition, with the included battery magazine, you can also run the camera off six AA batteries. The BG-E11 also provides full vertical shooting controls, which can be independently turned on or off as the photographer needs to enhance camera handling, especially for shooting vertical pictures. It has a large number of operating controls as well: shutter button, Main Dial, multi-controller, AF point selection button, AE lock/FE lock button, AF start button, and multi-function button.</p>

<p>A revealing title into the inner politics of the Congress Party, The Accidental Prime Minister deals with Manmohan Singh and his conflicts with the president of the Congress Party.The life of the 13th Prime Minister of India is fraught with constant conflict from both the opposing party and his own party. In this book by his former spokesperson, the author puts forth the argument that Mr. Manmohan Singh is in a constant battle for power, as the principal portion of it rests with the Congress Party President, Sonia Gandhi. Portraying an empathic image of the Prime Minister, Baru's book interprets the relationship between the two juggernauts of the Congress party as a tug of war, and portrays Mrs. Gandhi as the constant victor. Revealing several controversial details about the Congress Party, this book is sure to catch the eyes of readers and make them ask questions it tries to answer.</p>

<p><strong>Editorial Reviews :</strong></p>
<p>Few days ago, I was reading news paper and find a cartoon there, that was the time when Academy Awards were announced and in that cartoon it was mentioned that our three big politician were floating in the air (representing the success of the Oscar wining movie ""gravity) and one person on the ground showing similarity with our PM was appearing very happy with a trophy in his hand and it was mentioned 10 years a slave (representing the 10 years tenure of Dr. Singh as PM in NDA1 and NDA2). On that day I smiled but after reading this book, I do not have smile on my face but little bit happiness (I do not know why?) and sympathy for Dr. Singh. Before reading this book, I have an opinion that Dr. Singh has disgraced his dignity and strength, for the loyalty for Gandhi family but now since the facts have come out in an unfashionable manner, I am happy that at least he was not fully comfortable with what he was doing since last 10 years as PM of this country. The book has been written in very interesting manner, You will find that you are reading a TV serial and good thing is that this book talks about the people who are alive and are with us in the politics of the country. Well the timing of this book is slight late, I wish the things mentioned in this book could have been discussed publicly before the election. I know opposition will try to make its own benefit from the content of the book but the thing is that we all know that the power switch of the government was not in the hand of Dr. Manmohan Singh but in the hand of other person. I am sure that now Dr. Singh will be feeling relaxed, as this is something that even he would be thinking to make public for keeping his position clear. But again the last question from Dr. Singh, why you allowed this all rubbish to happen ? --Abhishek Shankhdhar Apr 12, 2014</p>
<p>Anyone calling this book work of fiction are living in a fictional world. Most of the things written, I could personally recall reading them in newspaper. The most curious part comes in the end and that's the nuclear deal. I had made some predictions and assumption about the deal.. which turned out mostly were correct. The book is very engaging, well written. People trying to figure out some intimate secrets about the PMO would be slightly disappointed, since most of the things are in public domain. --Chaitannya Mahatme Apr 20, 2014</p>
<p>Well, you would be, both, surprised and, not-surprised, after you read this. One side you will find a person who has risen from ashes, and achieved something unique and exceptional while striving as a nobody. You will applaud the compassion Mr. Singh has shown till 1991 and the kind of respect he gathered from his peers as associates. This book, very neatly, describes how a person with so high, an integrity and learning, succumbs to an authority, who intellectually, is nothing but miniscule when kept beside Mr. Singh, and while she remained dominating, how Mr. Singh remained unresponsive and numb to even raise his voice. Being a PM has always remained a matter of supreme pride and honor and responsibility, and as a citizen with a serious interest in Indian Polity, I have never seen any torch bearer of my country so incapacitated and helpless. He deserves this blame, as it was his duty to overcome such aggression and recognize what he remained for these 10 years. An Accidental, Numb PM. --Amrit Ravi Apr 24, 2014</p>

<p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>
<p>James McConnachie was born and brought up in south London, and was a scholar at Jesus College, Oxford, where he studied English. Touring the Loire in the back seat of a Citro&euml;n DS, as a child, inspired an early love of travel, but his first trips for Rough Guides were to Spain and Italy - and he remains passionate about both countries. Then, in 2002, James joined Dave Reed as co-author of the Rough Guide to Nepal. As a student, he had spent nine months teaching in a village in the Everest foothills, but travelling all over the country, in the middle of a Maoist insurrection, really put his knowledge of Nepali culture and language to the test - and never more urgently than when persuading a local Maoist that he was not in fact a CIA spy. After Nepal, James returned to his Francophile roots. He was commissioned to rewrite the Rough Guide to Paris, alongside Ruth Blackmore, and then headed back to the Loire valley to write his own, new guidebook: the Rough Guide to the Loire. Meanwhile, travel-related TV and radio appearances, including stints on the sofa with Richard and Judy and guesting on Radio 4's Excess Baggage, led to presenting work on Italy Inside Out, a five-part BBC series on Italian language and culture, and Kirsty Wark's Tales from Paris. James has also taken photographs for Rough Guides in Rome, Florence, Venice and Hawaii.In recent years, James has turned to history. With Robin Tudge, he co-authored the bestelling Rough Guide to Conspiracy Theories, which exposes the truth behind over a hundred conspiracy canards, and explores whether there is a conspiracist version of history. Bevis Hillier, in the Spectator, called it ""unusually intelligent and laced with black humour"". In The Book of Love: In Search of the Kamasutra (Atlantic), James traced the secretive story of the world's most notorious sex book, focusing on its discovery and pirate publication by the nineteenth-century explorer Richard Burton and his scandal-mongering coterie. William Dalrymple, writing in The Times, called it ""elegant and stylish"", The Washington Post found it a ""first-rate work of intellectual history"", and it won him a shortlisting for Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year 2008. Scandalized by the shrill and shallow quality of most modern sex manuals, James then decided to write his own: a book that wouldn't only discuss ""how to do it"", but would bring in history, ethics, politics, science and culture as well. The Observer called his subsequent Rough Guide to Sex ""a comprehensive, fearless book, part socio-history and part manual"". The writer and feminist Jenny Diski found it ""funny and thoughtful""; the book's ""clarity and straightforwardness"", she reckoned, ""would make anyone who has been young and befuddled (or old and befuddled) weep with gratitude."" James now lives in Winchester, Hampshire, with his young family, but makes regular trips to France and Nepal to keep his guidebooks up to date. He is passionate about singing, books, languages, walking and wildlife. He is represented by David Godwin</p>",,,taxable,,1,100,1,Literature & Fiction,1789.7600000000002,1598,https://www.reddoko.com/uploads/342/1497582200.9781405390026.jpg

<p>""Alexander's behavior was conditioned along certain lines -- heroism, courage, strength, superstition, bisexuality, intoxication, cruelty. He bestrode Europe and Asia like a supernatural figure.""</p>
<p>In this succinct portrait of Alexander the Great, distinguished scholar and historian Norman Cantor illuminates the personal life and military conquests of this most legendary of men. Cantor draws from the major writings of Alexander's contemporaries combined with the most recent psychological and cultural studies to show Alexander as he was -- a great figure in the ancient world whose puzzling personality greatly fueled his military accomplishments.</p>
<p>He describes Alexander's ambiguous relationship with his father, Philip II of Macedon; his oedipal involvement with his mother, the Albanian princess Olympias; and his bisexuality. He traces Alexander's attempts to bridge the East and West, the Greek and Persian worlds, using Achilles, hero of the Trojan War, as his model. Finally, Cantor explores Alexander's view of himself in relation to the pagan gods of Greece and Egypt.</p>
<p>More than a biography, Norman Cantor's Alexander the Great is a psychological rendering of a man of his time.</p>

<p>This volume brings together Freud's main contributions to the psychology of love. His illuminating discussions of the ways in which sexuality is always psychosexuality - that there is no sexuality without fantasy, conscious or unconscious - have changed the ways we think about erotic life. In these papers Freud develops his now famous theories about the sexuality of childhood and the transgressive nature of human desire.</p>
<p>In the famous case study of the eighteen-year-old 'Dora', we see Freud at work, both putting into practice and testing his sexual theories that were to change the modern world.</p>

<p>A human being who lives in harmony with himself can set great events into motion and be of great benefit. His actions are the expression of his mental state and thus mirror his thoughts. The source of each action is the thought. The mere presence of such a human being is pure inspiration, beneficial for the soul and spirit-enrichment for our lives. We live in a world that moves so fast that we re in a perpetual race to keep up without even realizing it. Living in fast-forward mode with no time to breathe is sadly seen as a sign of a successful career or a fabulous social life. What we re losing sight of is that stress holds us back from reaching our full potential. It makes us uptight. And it s not just our body that s affected, but also our peace of mind. We re tense, edgy and reactive, effectively blocking the free flow of our creative energy. Do we really want to live a life where each day feels like a giant to-do list whose tasks we must complete? The decades-long work of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar has proven that managing stress is as valuable an exercise as managing one s time. With body postures, breathing exercises, meditation and the knowledge of basic spiritual principles, it is far easier to combat daily stressors and stay on the path to fulfilment. The Art of Stress-Free Living will show you how clarity of mind supports your intuitive intelligence and will give you the freedom to live out new paradigms. You ll start finding surprising solutions to previously insurmountable problems and learn to live artfully, freely and happily so that you can make the most of every day.</p>",,,taxable,,1,100,1,Literature & Fiction,535.36,478,https://www.reddoko.com/uploads/357/1497582201.9789381431061.jpg

<p>Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel Garcia Marquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master.</p>
<p>Alternately reverential and comical, One Hundred Years of Solitude weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an accounting of the history of the human race.</p>

<p><strong>From the Inside Flap</strong></p>
<p>A man returns to the town where a baffling murder took place 27 years earlier, determined to get to the bottom of the story. Just hours after marrying the beautiful Angela Vicario, everyone agrees, Bayardo San Roman returned his bride in disgrace to her parents. Her distraught family forced her to name her first lover; and her twin brothers announced their intention to murder Santiago Nasar for dishonoring their sister.</p>
<p>Yet if everyone knew the murder was going to happen, why did no one intervene to stop it? The more that is learned, the less is understood, and as the story races to its inexplicable conclusion, an entire society--not just a pair of murderers--is put on trial. --This text refers to an alternate Paperback edition.</p>

Kafka Tamura runs away from home at fifteen, under the shadow of his father's dark prophesy. The aging Nakata, tracker of lost cats, who never recovered from a bizarre childhood affliction, finds his pleasantly simplified life suddenly turned upside down. Their parallel odysseys are enriched throughout by vivid accomplices and mesmerizing dramas. Cats converse with people; fish tumble from the sky; a ghostlike pimp deploys a Hegel-spouting girl of the night; a forest harbors soldiers apparently un-aged since WWII. There is a savage killing, but the identity of both victim and killer is a riddle. Murakami's novel is at once a classic quest, but it is also a bold exploration of mythic and contemporary taboos, of patricide, of mother-love, of sister-love. Above all it is a bewitching and wildly inventive novel from a master stylist.</p>

In spite of the perpetrators' intentions, the Tokyo gas attack left only twelve people dead, but thousands were injured and many suffered serious after-effects. The novelist Haruki Murakami interviews the victims to try and establish precisely what happened on the subway that day. He also interviews members and ex-members of the doomsday cult responsible, in the hope that they might be able to explain the reason for the attack and how it was that their guru instilled such devotion in his followers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Editorial Reviews :</strong> ""Murakami shares with Alfred Hitchcock a fascination for ordinary people being suddenly plucked by extraordinary circumstances from their daily lives"" Sunday Telegraph ""Not just an impressive essay in witness literature, but also a unique sounding of the quotidian Japanese mind"" Independent ""A scrupulous and unhistrionic look into the heart of the horror"" Scotsman ""The testimonies he assembles are striking.

<p><strong>From the Inside Flap</strong></p>
<p>From Haruki Murakami, internationally acclaimed author of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle"" and Norwegian Wood, a work of literary journalism that is as fascinating as it is necessary, as provocative as it is profound.</p>
<p>In March of 1995, agents of a Japanese religious cult attacked the Tokyo subway system with sarin, a gas twenty-six times as deadly as cyanide. Attempting to discover why, Murakami conducted hundreds of interviews with the people involved, from the survivors to the perpetrators to the relatives of those who died, and Underground is their story in their own voices. Concerned with the fundamental issues that led to the attack as well as these personal accounts, underground is a document of what happened in Tokyo as well as a warning of what could happen anywhere. This is an enthralling and unique work of nonfiction that is timely and vital and as wonderfully executed as Murakami's brilliant novels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>From the Back Cover</strong></p>
<p>It was a clear spring day, Monday, March 20, 1995, when five members of the religious cult Aum Shinrikyo conducted chemical warfare on the Tokyo subway system using sarin, a poison gas twenty-six times as deadly as cyanide. The unthinkable had happened, a major urban transit system had become the target of a terrorist attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an attempt to discover why, Haruki Murakami, internationally acclaimed author of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and arguably Japan's most important contemporary novelist, talked to the people who lived through the catastrophe -- from a Subway Authority employee with survivor guilt, to a fashion salesman with more venom for the media than for the perpetrators, to a young cult member who vehemently condemns the attack though he has not quit Aum. Through these and many other voices, Murakami exposes intriguing aspects of the Japanese psyche. And as he discerns the fundamental issues leading to the attack, we achieve a clear vision of an event that could occur anytime, anywhere. Hauntingly compelling and inescapably important, underground is a powerful work of journalistic literature from one of the world's most perceptive writers.</p>

simple,S5-13,Skagboys,1,1,visible,This is product description,"<p><strong>About Book :</strong> Both a prequel to the world-renowned Trainspotting, and an alternative version of it, Skagboys is Irvine Welsh's greatest work.</p>
<p>Mark Renton seems to have it all: he's the first in his family to go to university, he's young, has a pretty girlfriend and a great social life. But Thatcher's government is destroying working-class communities across Britain, and the post-war certainties of full employment, educational opportunity and a welfare state are gone. When his badly handicapped younger brother dies the family bonds start to weaken, his life flips out of control, and he succumbs to the defeatism and the heroin which has taken hold in Edinburgh's grimmer areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;His friends face similar challenges. Spud Murphy is paid off from his job and faces long-term unemployment, while Tommy Lawrence feels that only love can save him from being sucked into a life of petty crime and violence -- exemplified respectively by the thieving Matty Connell and psychotic Franco Begbie. And then there is Sick Boy, the supreme manipulator of the opposite sex, scamming and hustling his way through life.</p>
<p>Skagboys charts their journey from likely lads to young men addicted to the heroin which has flooded their disintegrating community. This is the 1980s: not the sanitized version, of upbeat pop music, mullets, shoulder-pads and MTV, but a time of drugs, poverty, AIDS, violence, political strife and hatred -- and maybe just a little love; a decade which changed Britain for ever. The prequel to the world-renowned Trainspotting, this is an exhilarating and moving book, full of the scabrous humour, salty vernacular and appalling behaviour that has made Irvine Welsh a household name.</p>

simple,S5-14,Catch 22,1,1,visible,This is product description,"<p><strong>About Book :</strong> Arguably the best novel to come out of World War II, in which Heller strips away the veneer of martial glory to expose its insanity, and gives our language a new paradoxical phrase to describe mankind at the mercy of its own institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Editorial Reviews :</strong> Satirical novel by Joseph Heller, first published in 1961. The plot of the novel centers on the antihero Captain John Yossarian, stationed at an airstrip on a Mediterranean island in World War II, and portrays his desperate attempts to stay alive. The ""catch"" in Catch-22 involves a mysterious Air Force regulation which asserts that a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but that if he makes the necessary formal request to be relieved of such missions, the very act of making the request proves that he is sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved. The term catch-22 thereafter entered the English language with the meaning ""a problematic situation for which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem"" and later developed several additional senses. In 1994 Heller published a sequel entitled Closing Time, which details the current lives of the characters established in Catch-22. -- The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>
<p>Joseph Heller was born in Brooklyn in 1923. In 1961, he published Catch-22, which became a bestseller and, in 1970, a film. He went on to write such novels as Good as Gold, God Knows, Picture This, Closing Time, and Portrait of an Artist, as an Old Man. Heller died in 1999.</p>

<p>The EOS 80D boasts a viewfinder coverage of approx. 100%. The newly-developed 45-point, all cross-type AF sensor and continuous shooting speed of up to 7.0fps makes it an excellent choice for capturing moving subjects. Movie shooting at a quality of up to Full HD 60p is also supported, and Dual Pixel CMOS AF, which makes it possible to achieve high speed AF during Live View shooting, has been enhanced to be compatible for use with all EF lenses. Remote shooting and image sharing with smart devices is also made simple as the camera supports Wi-Fi and NFC.<br>24 MP APS-C CMOS + DIGIC 6<br>45-point All Cross-Type AF<br>Dual Pixel CMOS AF</p>
<p><strong>7.0fps High Speed Continuous Shooting with 24 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and DIGIC 6 Imaging Processor</strong></p>
<p>The EOS 80D&rsquo;s 24.2MP, APS-C CMOS sensor realizes high resolution photo quality, where landscapes and still life shots are rendered with even greater detail, and skin tones and textures with even better precision. The tremendous volume of data generated undergoes high speed processing via the DIGIC 6 processor, enabling speeds of up to 7.0fps for photos (continuous shooting) and Full HD 60p/50p for movies to be achieved. ISO speed has also been enhanced up to a normal ISO of 16000 (12800 during movie shooting), and an expanded ISO of up to ISO 25600, allowing the capture of beautiful shots at fast shutter speeds, even in low light conditions. The focusing brightness range for viewfinder shooting has been increased up to EV -3, allowing improved AF performance in extremely low light scenes.</p>
<p><strong>45-point All Cross-Type AF &amp; Intelligent Viewfinder</strong></p>
<p>The AF sensor covers a large portion of the viewfinder and consists of 45 selectable points, all of which are cross-type. It enables precise AF tracking, even during 7.0fps high speed continuous shooting. 27 of the points can be used to focus with f/8, which means carrying out AF will be a pleasant experience even when using an extender. Combined with the 7,560-pixel RGB + IR metering system which tracks and detects colour, not only is the precision of the Scene Detection System improved and overall exposure clarity enhanced, you can also expect even more accurate focus on human subjects. Supplementing the APS-C camera is its viewfinder, which not only has approximately 100% coverage but also comes equipped with Intelligent Viewfinder. Thanks to the display of a variety of shooting information such as the electronic level, and a multiple aspect ratio shooting image area (including 1:1), viewfinder shooting is easier and more convenient than ever.</p>

simple,SD-59,Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) Small,1,1,visible,This is product description,"<p><strong>About Product</strong></p>
<p>This is a small force sensitive resistor. It has a 0.16"" (4 mm) diameter active sensing area. This FSR will vary its resistance depending on how much pressure is being applied to the sensing area. The harder the force, the lower the resistance. When no pressure is being applied to the FSR, its resistance will be larger than 1M&Omega;, with full pressure applied the resistance will be 2.5k&Omega;. Two pins extend from the bottom of the sensor with 0.1"" pitch making it bread board friendly. These sensors are simple to set up and great for sensing pressure, but they aren't incredibly accurate. Use them to sense if it's being squeezed, but you may not want to use it as a scale.<br />Dimensions:<br />Overall length: 1.75""<br />Overall width: 0.28""<br />Sensing area: 0.3""</p>",,,taxable,,1,100,1,Sensor Modules,1170.4,1045,https://www.reddoko.com/uploads/4107/1501480087.17.jpg

<p>One of the most versatile focal lengths available, the EF 50mm f/1.8 STM Lens from Canon pairs this classic lens design with enhancements to the AF system and physical design that make it both faster and smaller. Utilizing an STM stepping motor, this lens is ideal for both still and video shooting due to its speedy and smooth operation. Further benefitting video shooters, the STM motor also supports the Movie Servo AF mode on select DSLRs for precise and near-silent focusing. An updated exterior design includes a metal lens mount and a re-located focusing ring in order to accommodate the compact overall form factor. The 50mm f/1.8 is a classic, tested lens design, and thanks to enhanced autofocus and a svelte profile, this lens is ideal for everyday shooting in a wide variety of conditions.<br>The optical design of this lens incorporates optimized coatings that help to reduce flare and ghosting for increased contrast and color neutrality. The f/1.8 maximum aperture is effective for low-light shooting as well as for controlling your focus plane for selective focus shooting. Seven rounded diaphragm blades further enhance the look of out of focus regions in an image, making it well-suited to portraiture and creative environmental shooting.</p>
<p>Standard prime 50mm lens is designed for use on full-frame EOS DSLR, however can also be used with APS-C-sized sensors where it will provide an 80mm equivalent focal length.<br>Fast f/1.8 maximum aperture benefits working in low-light conditions and also enables precise control over the focus plane when working with selective focus techniques. Seven rounded diaphragm blades further contribute to a pleasing out of focus quality with shallow depth of field imagery.<br>A gear-type STM stepping motor is incorporated into the lens' design to provide quick, smooth, and near silent autofocus performance. Additionally, this focusing mechanism also pairs well with EOS cameras featuring the Move Servo AF mode to enable continuous focusing performance when working in live view.<br>Full-time manual focus override is available for fine-tuning your focus position for selective focus applications.<br>Optimized lens coatings help to suppress lens flare and ghosting for increased contrast and more color-neutral imagery.<br>An enhanced exterior design features a metal lens mount for durability as well as a re-located focusing ring to maintain a compact 2.7 x 1.5"" form factor.</p>

<div>KEY FEATURES</div>

<div>This expansion board as a driver expansion board, can be used for engraving machines, 3D printers. It is a total of four slots, can drive four A4988 stepper motor. Each road stepper motors only need two IO ports. In other words, six IO ports can be well managed three stepper motors. It is very convenient to use.</div>

<div>Features:</div>

<div>·  Enlarged board to add a 4th Axis that can clone the X,Y or Z axis. With a 4th option to use pin D12-13 to control it.</div>

<div>·  Added a breakout header for all the Axis’s</div>

<div>·  Added a communication header for UART(Serail) and I2C</div>

<div>·  Added the a connector for an optional fuse.(Fuse not supplies as it needs to be selected for the current that will be used.)</div>

<div>·  Capacitors are mounted horizontally giving more clearance between them and the stepper drivers. Good for ventilation.</div>

<div>·  Added a pull-up resistor on the axis enable pins. This prevents the pin from being in a floating state</div>

<div>·  Added 2 mounting holes</div>",,,taxable,,1,100,1,Arduino & Shield,554.4000000000001,495,https://www.reddoko.com/uploads/8663/1510917007.1.jpg

<ul>
<li>A simple Flex Sensor 2.2"" in length. As the sensor is flexed, the resistance across the sensor increases.</li>
<li>Patented technology by Spectra Symbol - they claim these sensors were used in the original Nintendo Power Glove. I love the Nintendo Power Glove. It's so bad!</li>
</ul>
<p>The resistance of the flex sensor changes when the metal pads are on the outside of the bend (text on inside of bend). Connector is 0.1"" spaced and bread board friendly. Check datasheet for full specifications.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Please refrain from flexing or straining this sensor at the base. The usable range of the sensor can be flexed without a problem, but care should be taken to minimize flexing outside of the usable range. For best results, securely mount the base and bottom portion and only allow the actual flex sensor to flex.</li>

<ul>
<li>TCS3200 Color Sensor is a complete color detector, including a TAOS TCS3200 RGB sensor chip and 4 white LEDs. The TCS3200 can detect and measure a nearly limitless range of visible colors. Applications include test strip reading, sorting by color, ambient light sensing and calibration, and color matching, to name just a few.<br /> </li>
<li>The TCS3200 has an array of photodetectors, each with either a red, green, or blue filter, or no filter (clear). The filters of each color are distributed evenly throughout the array to eliminate location bias among the colors. Internal to the device is an oscillator which produces a square-wave output whose frequency is proportional to the intensity of the chosen color.<br /> <br /> <br /><strong>Specification</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>The LM35 is a low voltage IC which uses approximately +5VDC of power.</li>
<li>The IC has just 3 pins, 2 for the power supply and one for the analog output.</li>
<li>The output pin provides an analog voltage output that is linearly proportional to the celsius (centigrade) temperature. Pin 2 gives an output of 1 millivolt per 0.1&deg;C (10mV per degree).</li>
<li>So to get the degree value in celsius, all that must be done is to take the voltage output and divide it by 10- this give out the value degrees in celsius.</li>

As a result, for years you could basically change protein brands every month and see no difference in gains at all. This changed with the launch of Nitro-Tech. MuscleTech researchers invested countless hours working to create a protein formula that packs on more muscle and builds more strength than regular whey protein. With the powerful Nitro-Tech formula, they succeeded and now bodybuilders and other athletes have an advanced whey protein supplement that actually delivers superior musclebuilding results!*</p>

As a result, for years you could basically change protein brands every month and see no difference in gains at all. This changed with the launch of Nitro-Tech.

MuscleTech researchers knew this when they created the original AMINO BUILD formula, and thats why they engineered more than just another me too amino formula. Instead, AMINO BUILD was developed with elite athletes in mind and formulated with clinically researched ingredients that drive peak performance including a massive dose of BCAAs, clinically researched doses of leucine, and betaine that other amino formulas simply didnt have.*</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This excellent new PVC covered steel cable has no-slip grip ergonomic handles with the cord length printed on handle end. With its new heavy duty yoke connection ensures a tangle free steel cord will hold up to intense use while maintaining flexibility. Also has an ABEC-3 ball bearing for twist free action.</p>
<p>The length of the rope can be shortened by removing the end caps on the handles. You then simply slide down the retaining plastic stop and then cut to the required length (please note that once you have shorted the speed rope you cannot lengthen it again). Probably the best speed rope that you can purchase at this fantastic price and recommended for people up to 6 feets.</p>
<p>Recommended for indoor use only.</p>

<p>The perfect fit for tight fitted shoes as it sits discreetly in your shoe and gives ultra comfort.</p>
<p>This device is made a flexible polypropylene and has the same high quality that you would normally expect costing 5 times as much if you ordered bespoke orthotics through a clinician. The ultra durable resin shell will not crack or deform after use and is not heat mouldable. This means it will not distort under extreme conditions either.</p>
<p>The cut out below the 1st toe allows that part of the foot to function as it was designed to do. The shape of the arch supports not only the mid foot but the important structures between your heel and your arch, which research has concluded is vital if we are to correctly control the foot.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The tubes are made from TPR (Thermoplastic Rubber) which then has a soft nylon outer sleeve that covers the whole of the tube. The reason for this is that in the unlikely event that should the inner TPR tube break or snap whilst exercising, the nylon sleeve will restrict the amount of movement so to avoid any potential injury that the snapping of a tube may cause.</p>
<p>All 66fit safety exercise tubes are 1.4m in length and have detachable metal clip handles. This enables the user to add an extra 66fit safety tube should they feel the need to increase the amount of resistance required. There are 5 different resistive strengths in the range starting from a level 1 going up to level 5.</p>

simple,S4F-47,66fit D3D Orthotic Insoles,1,1,visible,This is product description,"<div>
<p>The D3D Orthotic Insole is tailored to the dynamic pressure measurement calculations from footscan technologies, and is therefore specified by the dynamic functioning of the foot.</p>
<p>This has been a revolution in orthotic prescription. Suitable for Men and Womens shoes.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Performance Insole:</strong><br>The foot is a fantastic auto-support mechanism for your body. When you over pronate or have low arches, the system fails. This failure leads to a misalignment of your body resulting in pain in almost any part of you. Performance insoles from RSscan move your foot back to its natural position improving posture relieving many chronic complaints keeping your feet comfortable every step of the day.</p>
<p>Orthotics have been scientifically proven to reduce the risk of and rehabilitate injuries such as; heel pain, Achilles tendonitis, shin splints, calf strain, knee damage and postural back pain. Performance orthotics can help relieve foot, heel, ankle, knee, hip and back pain and reduce fatigue by realigning the body.</p>
<p><strong>What happens to the foot?</strong><br>As your arch flattens from excessive pronation your heel position changes, putting increased pressure on the inside of your heel. As a result;<br>1. Flat or excessively pronated feet are left unstable with no secure platform for propulsion and no shock absorption.<br>2. Flat feet also causes the big toe not to bend properly resulting in pain both at the big toe joint and plantar fascia leading to painful heels, arches and hammer toe deformities.<br>3. Flat feet also twist the lower leg inward altering the kneecap position and damaging the leg muscles and knee cartilage, causing pain on the inner edge or front of the knee.</p>
<p><strong>Why is performance insole so good?</strong><br>While most shoe inserts are designed around a theoretical natural position the performance orthotic is a replacement insole uniquely designed, using Olympic athletes, to support the dynamic running and walking foot.</p>
<p>Your performance orthotic is contoured to cradle the heel, while its ergonomically designed arch provides superior support and comfort allowing your foot to absorb the shock of walking and running by restoring the natural balance of your foot function.</p>
<p><strong>Insole Options</strong><br><strong>BLUE</strong> one lighter insole providing high level shock absorption, specifically designed to fit any job, form normal walking to high level athletics. Suitable for people of up to <strong>79kg</strong> or needing superior cushioning.</p>
<p><strong>RED</strong> one specifically produced for high impact sports such as basketball and for people over <strong>80kg</strong>, maintaining your foot structure under greater pressure.</p>
<p>Recommended for every day and sports shoe, including outdoor footwear, Performance orthotics are designed to withstand increased and prolonged repetitive forces.</p>
<p>The D3D functional design includes:<br>1. A deep heel cup to stabilise movements at the heel and ankle<br>2. A unique lift to stabilise the end of heel stance and reduce the degree of pronatory moment as the foot enters mid-stance.<br>3. Ergonomically designed arch support specific to the moving foot, lifting and supporting both the entire arch profile.<br>4. Increased mid-foot support along the length of the inside and outside of the foot.<br>5. A ""met dome"" to improve the integrity of the transverse metatarsal arch in the forefoot, reducing peak pressures and friction under the ball of the foot.</p>
<p>Two distinct types of Performance orthotic exist;</p>
<p>a) Blue Performance (for sports applications) Medium density EVA, this orthotic weighs 50grams.<br>b) Red Performance (for people with a higher body mass or higher impact sports) Medium / High density EVA , this orthotic weighs 60grams</p>
<p>Both types come in sizes 3 -12 and three different arch heights; please read the information below to ensure you obtain the correct insole.</p>
<p>1. F (low arch height) <br>2. FN (low - normal arch height with added arch support)<br>3. N (for high arch) to accommodate a variety of foot types.</p>
<p>Price shown if for a pair of D3D Insoles<br><strong>Foot Arch Height</strong><br>To determine your foot arch height, simply read the information below and also look at the image above which will show you how to determine the type of insole your require.</p>
<p><strong>Flat Arch:</strong> If you find it difficult to slide a finger under the middle of your foot and if your arch on your right / left foot seems to be touching the ground in the mid-foot, your foot type is FLAT and you require the F type</p>
<p><strong>Normal Arch:</strong> If you find you can slide a finger under the middle of your foot and if you can see a small gap between the ground and foot, your foot type is FLAT/NORMAL and you require the FN type.</p>
<p><strong>High Arch:</strong> If you can with ease put a finger under the middle of your foot and if you can see a curve on your right / left foot, your foot type is HIGH and you require the N type.</p>
